## My process
First of all, i wrap my code in a single div and gave each sections their own div also.  I gave the body a background of light grey and the wrapper a white background.
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
- working with css flexbox
-- css box shadow

### Continued development

I will love to work on project and devlop them using react js and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
